### Course Notes..

</br>

**Object-Oriented** is a programming paradigm. A set of ideas that's supported by many languages.

**Object-Oriented Programing Language** like C#, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift and many others.

**Objects** is attributes, properties, characteristics, state, fields, variables.

**Classes** is code-template for creating program objects.
</br>
</br>

**Basics of object-oriented programming**:

* **Abstraction**

  * Abstraction is a natural extension of encapsulation.
    You have a lot of things in your cars but what happens to make it move doesn't concern you and any update to its mechanism rarely affect the abstraction you use.

    * Cars are complex. But using them is simple.

- **Polymorphism**

  * The ability of an object to take on many forms.

    * Let's say we have same ingredients but we will use methods to have circle, square and different cake shapes.

- **Inheritance** 

  * Reusing the common logic and extract unique logic into a separate class.

    * A high school student is type of student. A student is a type of person.

* **Encapsulation**

  * Bundling data and methods that work on that data within one class, To restrict access to some of the methods.

    * School bag can keep your books, pens and no one can access it as long you have it.

**Object-Oriented** to develop any software you need three things:

- Analysis: Understand your problem.

- Design: Plan your solution.

- Programing: Build it.

ex. Create a space microwave to go onboard our lunar space ship. So astronauts can have nice warm meals on their way to the moon.

**Requirements** What does it need to do!

- **Functional Requirements** What must it do?
  - The system must <u>Heat food in space packages</u>.
  - The system must  <u>Allow the user to set a time for the food to be ready</u>.
  - The system must  <u>Notify the user when their food is ready, via space pager</u>.
  - The system must  <u>Set the cooking-time based on the food</u>.

- **Non-Functional Requirements** How should it do it?
  - The system should <u>Be available 24/7</u>.
  - The system should <u>Be usable while wearing work gloves</u>.
    </br>
    </br>

**FURPS** is a checklist of several key qualities to consider when determining requirements:

- **F**unctionality refers to the capabilities and features of the app (Capability, Reusability, Security).
- **U**sability affects the person who will be using the program (Human Factors, Aesthetics, Consistency, Documentation).
- **R**eliability is how much system downtime is acceptable. If the failures are predictable and how the system can be recovered.
- **P**erformance dictate the application's response time through put (Speed, Efficiency, Resource, Consumption, Scalability). 
- **S**upportability is to make sure the application can be tested, extended, serviced and installed and configured.

**General development principles**:

- **SOLID**: Acronym for five design principles.

  **S**ingle responsibility: A class should only have a single responsibility.
  **O**penâ€“closed: A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  **L**iskov substitution: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of program.
  **I**nterface segregation: Segregate interfaces as per the requirements of program, rather one general purpose implementation.
  **D**ependency inversion: Should depend on abstractions rather than implementations.

- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself: Principle aimed to reducing repetition of information.

- **YAGNI**: You Ain't Gonna Need It.
