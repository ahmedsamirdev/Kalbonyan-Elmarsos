### Course Notes..

</br>


**QA** is to prevent problems in application so that user dont encouter bugs and crashes.

</br>

**Roles of QA:**

- Technical aptitude:
  - Manual testing.
  - Automated testing.
  - Programming.
  - Scripting.

- Business knowledge:
  - Feature scoping.
  - Test planning.
  - Test case management.
  - Bug management.

- DevOps principles:
  - Configure tools.
  - Setup CI.
  - Setup test environments.
  - Automate process.

- Process and release expertise:
  - Define and improve testing practices.
  - Optimize release process.

</br>

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

- Plan:
  - Identify risks.
  - Identify use cases.

- Define:
  - Write specs and acceptance critieria.
  - Decide what's in scope.
  - Write test scenario.

- Design and Build:
  - Solidify test scenarios.
  - Get feedback on scenarios from team.
  - Manual and automation test.

- Test:
  - Manual and automation tests.
  - Accepting testing.

- Deploy:
  - Validate functionality.
  - Release.
  - Test in production.

</br>

**Testing planning consisting of:**

- Create test strategy.
- Make plan test.
- Write acceptance criteria.
- Identity when testing is done.

</br>

**Types of testing:**

- Black Box testing (Testing as normal user - by QA during Test phase):
  - Manual testing.
  - UI automation testing.

- Gray box testing  (Testing with understanding of the app - by QA & Developer during Build and Test phase):
  - Intergration testing.

- White box testing (Test code and system - by Developer):
  - Unit.
  - System. 

- Performance testing (by QA):
  - Load testing (check ability to perform under user loads).
  - Stress testing (measure software stability).
  - Endurance testing (how app handles load over time).
  - Security testing (reveal flaws that can be exposed by users - by QA or Security team).
    </br>

**Bug** is when system doesn't work as designed.
</br>

**Bug Reporting system** (Jira - BugZilla):

- Report.
- Triage (severity - priority).
- View.
- Assign.
- Close.
  </br>
