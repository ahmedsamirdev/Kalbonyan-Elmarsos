`git status` to check if there changes in files in working directory which not in staging yet.

`git add .` to add all files in the directory to staging.

`git add <FILE_NAME>` to add file to staging.

`git commit -a <FILE_NAME>` to add file to repo directly.

`git commit -am "WRITE_YOUR_MESSAGE"` to add file to repo directly.

`git commit --all` to add all files to repo directly.

`git show <WRITE_SHA_COMMIT>` to view earlier commit.

`git mv <FILE_NAME>` to rename file (in same path) or move file to another directory.

`git rm <FILE_NAME>` to delete file from working ready to commit and delete from git repo.

`git diff` to check changes in files as compare working and staging changes.

`git diff --staged` to check changes in files as compare staging and repository changes.

`git diff --color-words` show only the words that changed.

`git diff <WRITE_SHA_COMMIT>..<WRITE_SHA_COMMIT>` to compare commits.

`git checkout -- <FILE_NAME>`to undo changes in working directory from your repository (within same branch).

`git reset HEAD <FILE_NAME>` undo files changes after adding to staging tree.

`git checkout -- ` to undo changes in all files in working directory from your repository (within same branch).

`git commit --amend -m "WRITE_YOUR_MESSAGE"` to edit recent commit with new changes.

`git revert <WRITE_SHA_COMMIT>` to revert a commit (undo changes).

`git clean -f` to remove untracked files with `-f` to force removing (use `-n` to see untracked files first).

`.gitignore`this file contains files or folders name to prevent git from tracking them.

By default git ignores directories with no files, we use empty file named `.gitkeep` inside the directory to force to commits it although its empty.
